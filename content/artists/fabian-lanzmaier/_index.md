Fabian Lanzmaier works with sound and music, as a solo artist as well as in several formations combining sound with installations, theater, dance, moving image and live performances.

In his live performances he uses audio synthesis to explore aspects of texture and structure of sound as well as its presence within space. He is experimenting with perception and ideas of natural / artificial sounds, fluid and ambiguous environments. A maze into surreal surroundings of organic structures in constant movement and disruption.

He studied at the Institute for Electroacoustic Compostition in Vienna and is an active member of the collectives Columbosnext, Verschubu Records and Velak.
