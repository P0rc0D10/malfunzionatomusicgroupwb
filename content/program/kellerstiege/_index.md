musicians from fields of experimental music and soundart, who are either based or just happen to be in vienna come together at the studiospaces of garnison7 to perform and record in a very concentrated but friendly and social atmosphere.  
you are invited to come, listen and get drunk on arts...  
we charge you what you want to pay. the doormoney goes straight into the pocket of the musicians.  
sometimes you might even get some good food too.
