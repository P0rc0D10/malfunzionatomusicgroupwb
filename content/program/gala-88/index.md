_PRINT!_  

construct with printer and CD changer

The main idea of the piece is the omnipresence of machines and their motor. The regulation of speed causes unique sounds. Most of the times, they are perceived as disturbing. By a systematic compilation of these sounds and the movements of the motor, the sounds get into order again.

_THIS STRANGE FEELING OF A CORRECTED UNCERTAINTY MARGIN_

Radio Edition Nummer 5

Binary data will be anarchical treated by ignoring its original purpose and
forcing it to be translated into sound. Radio becomes a digital translating
tool, including voices, brains and computers.
