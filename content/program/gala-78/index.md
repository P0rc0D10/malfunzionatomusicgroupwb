#### skylla
Silvia Fässler: computer(ppooll), devices Billy Roisz: computer(kluppe), bass guitar, devices skylla is a monster. A sheering, scathing collision of computer generated sounds meshed with bass guitar and turntable.

#### christine schörkhuber
C. canned fit - Controlled coalition of the unpredictable. Circuits of simultaneity. Canned Noises, tinned tunes and melodic distorsions. The sound artist Christine Schörkhuber works with a fragile yet powerful setup consisting of self-built electronic analog interfaces, sonorous everyday commodities and her voice. The performance is trembling between subtle crunchy sounds, song fragments, noise-fields and penetrating drones.

#### sergio sanchez
Los Heraldos Negros (The Black Heralds in English) was founded in 2008 in Mexico City by Sergio Sánchez. It is a noise and experimental music project whose sound is mainly based on the use of heavily processed field recordings. The subject matter of these recordings tends to be the various political conflicts happening in the country of origin of its author.

#### chrs galarreta
The sublime and the uncertainty are present in his actions, he gets them using broken electrical appliances, homemade instruments, feedback systems, the induction of errors in hardware and electronic trash. He transduces imperceptible physical phenomena for humans to an audible dimension (as electromagnetic fields or sub-acuatic sounds).
